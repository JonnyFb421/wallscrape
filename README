Wallbase Scraper
0.2
This script will download wallpapers from the global toplist of Wallbase.cc.  
I had foolishly wrote this script without using an HTML Parser (just good ol' regex and beautifulsoup) so I decided try doing it the right way.
So far it's not nearly as efficent as the original script, but it's a work in progress. 

Also I'm new to git.
