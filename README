# Wallbase Scraper #
v0.4
This script will download wallpapers from the global toplist of Wallbase.cc.  This script is an exercise for me to get a better understanding of Python, threading, and queues.  

## Bugs ##


## To Do ##
Add URL back to queue if the HTTP request times out so user does not miss any downloads. Now that the worker threads spawn in range of queue.size() if I add it back to the queue it should try to downloading that again without skipping a beat.

Rename class TestyClass.  This class is responsible for the script being a bit slower than it could be.  It's subclass of HTMLParser currently using handle_data and using regex on all that HTML.  The solution to this is only pass the data within the <script> tags instead of ALL the data. 

Add ability to log in
